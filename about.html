  <h1>A Little About How Much I Love You</h1>
  <p>You Are My Absolute Favorite</p>
  <p>Here Is a Short Love Letter To You</p>

  <div id="love-letter">
    <p>To my sweet Dawson,</p>

    <p>
     I could fill up this entire page and more with reasons that you are the love of my life. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Dawson, you light up my entire world. You make sure that I am comfortable, and happy all the time. You are so smart, and genuine. You have such a caring and kind soul, I do not think you have ever once been mean to a person in your whole life. You handle my emotions so well, and you are so patient with me. You always check in on me and see how you can assist to make my days better. You are who I hope to be when I eventually grow up lol. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I know that sometimes I make you feel like you are a "bad boyfriend", but you are far far from. You do everything you can to make me happy, and I am so so lucky that you still choose to be around me and support me in every avenue of my life. You are who I want to be with forever, and you make me unbelievably happy. I know that sometimes it doesn't seem like it, but even when I am mad or upset over something silly, I still know that I am with the right person. You always end up making me smile, even when I am down or frustrated, and we always end up working everything out.
    </p>

     <p>
      To top off how incredibly you treat me too, you are absolutely adorable and I find you so cute and handsome. I find myself just staring at your cute face and wondering how I lucked out with such a wonderful man. Your smile is just amazing, and your eyes are so captivating. I wish that we could just stare at each other longer sometimes while laying in bed. You are my favorite person to cuddle up next to at night, and just my favorite person in general. 
    </p>

     <p>
      You are the love of my life, and I am so grateful to be yours. I love you so so so so soooooooooo much, and I will forever. üíô
    </p>
    <p><strong>- Your cutie</strong></p>
